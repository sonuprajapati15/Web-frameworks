## Introduction & Problem Scenario

Modern Java server frameworks offer a variety of models for handling web traffic, including classic thread-per-request, reactive/event loop, and hybrid approaches. High-latency, high-throughput workloads—such as a server with **1-core CPU, 4GB RAM**, and **40 million requests/day** (P95 latency: 4–10s; each request makes a third-party call with 10–60s response time)—push these models to their limits.

**Key constraints:**
- 1-core CPU, 4GB RAM per pod (Kubernetes)
- 40 million requests/day (≈463 req/sec average)
- Each request: high-latency third-party API call (10–60s)
- Event-streaming APIs: 10 million/day
- Wide range of media types: JSON, XML, CBOR, Protobuf, GraphQL, NDJSON, YAML, PDF, images, multipart, event-streams, etc.

---

## Evaluation Criteria & Architecture Scenario

For each model/technology, we evaluate:
- Internal Execution Model (threading, event loops, blocking/non-blocking IO)
- Sequence Diagram (client, server thread/event loop/virtual thread, kernel thread, third-party API, response)
- Resource Utilization (CPU, Memory, Threads)
- Kubernetes Sizing Calculation (pods required)
- Performance with Media Types
- Pros/Cons & Best Use Cases

## Model Deep Dives

### MVC (Traditional Servlet)

#### Overview
Classic Java web server model: each HTTP request handled by a dedicated **platform thread** from a pool (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, Spring MVC default).

#### Internal Execution Model
- **Thread-per-request**: Each request mapped to a platform thread.
- **Blocking IO**: Thread blocks for all IO (e.g., third-party API call).

#### Threading
- **Platform Threads** (OS/kernel threads): Limited (~100–400 per pod before memory/CPU thrashing).
- High-latency IO means most threads spend time blocked.

#### Blocking vs. Non-blocking IO
- **Blocking**: Each thread waits for IO.
- Not scalable for high-latency third-party calls.

#### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant ServerThread
    participant KernelThread
    participant ThirdPartyAPI

    Client->>ServerThread: HTTP Request
    ServerThread->>KernelThread: (OS schedules)
    KernelThread->>ThirdPartyAPI: Blocking API Call
    ThirdPartyAPI-->>KernelThread: Response
    ServerThread->>Client: HTTP Response
```
**Blocking points:** Thread blocked on third-party call.

#### Resource Utilization
- **CPU:** Underutilized (threads mostly block).
- **Memory:** High (each thread ~1MB stack).
- **Threads:** Thread pool size limits concurrency.

#### Kubernetes Sizing Calculation
- Avg concurrency ≈ `requests/sec × P95 latency` ≈ `463 × 10s = 4630` concurrent requests.
- Needs 4630 threads; with 300 threads/pod (practical), needs `≈16 pods`.
- But **1-core CPU** can't run 300+ kernel threads efficiently (context switch overhead).

#### Performance with Media Types
| Media Type     | Support | Latency | Memory | Notes                                        |
|----------------|---------|---------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| JSON/XML       | ✔️      | High    | High   | Native, but serialization/deserialization blocks a thread |
| Protobuf/CBOR  | ⚠️      | High    | High   | Needs extra libs, not idiomatic              |
| Images/PDF     | ✔️      | High    | High   | Streaming blocks a thread                    |
| NDJSON/Stream  | ✔️      | High    | High   | Each client holds a thread                   |
| GraphQL        | ⚠️      | High    | High   | Not a native fit                             |
| Others         | ✔️      | High    | High   | All blocking                                 |

#### Pros and Cons
| Pros               | Cons                                              |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Mature, familiar   | Not scalable for IO-bound workloads              |
| Simple debugging   | High memory/thread overhead                      |
| Broad media support| Thread pool exhaustion, bad for long-latency APIs|

#### Best Use Cases
- Low concurrency, CPU-bound, fast IO APIs.

### Spring MVC with Virtual Threads

#### Overview
Modernized thread-per-request model using **Java Virtual Threads (Project Loom)**.

#### Internal Execution Model
- Each request: **virtual thread** (lightweight, millions possible).
- Virtual thread blocks for IO, kernel thread reused elsewhere.

#### Threading
- **Virtual Threads**: Multiplexed onto a small pool of platform threads.
- Platform threads ~1/core.

#### Blocking vs. Non-blocking IO
- **Blocking IO**: Virtual thread blocks, not a platform thread.
- Dramatically improves scalability for IO-bound workloads.

#### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant VirtualThread
    participant PlatformThread
    participant KernelThread
    participant ThirdPartyAPI

    Client->>VirtualThread: HTTP Request
    VirtualThread->>PlatformThread: Schedules
    PlatformThread->>KernelThread: IO Syscall
    KernelThread->>ThirdPartyAPI: API Call
    ThirdPartyAPI-->>KernelThread: Response
    PlatformThread->>VirtualThread: Resume work
    VirtualThread->>Client: HTTP Response
```
**Blocking:** Only virtual thread blocked, platform thread is free.

#### Resource Utilization
- **CPU:** Efficient, minimal context switching.
- **Memory:** Low (virtual thread stack = few KB).
- **Threads:** 10,000s possible per pod.

#### Kubernetes Sizing Calculation
- 4630 concurrent requests = 4630 virtual threads (few MB RAM).
- **Pods needed:** `~2–3` (limited by CPU/network, not threads).

#### Performance with Media Types
| Media Type     | Support | Latency | Memory | Notes                     |
|----------------|---------|---------|--------|---------------------------|
| All            | ✔️      | Med     | Low    | Blocking safe, broad support |

#### Pros and Cons
| Pros             | Cons                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Code stays simple| Loom is new (ecosystem support maturing)  |
| Scales IO-bound  | Not as efficient as pure async for CPU    |

#### Best Use Cases
- High-latency IO, legacy code, easy migration.

### Quarkus (RESTEasy & RESTEasy Reactive)

#### Overview
- **RESTEasy:** Classic blocking JAX-RS (like servlet).
- **RESTEasy Reactive:** Event-loop, async/worker pool hybrid.

#### Internal Execution Model
- **RESTEasy:** Thread-per-request (see MVC above).
- **RESTEasy Reactive:** Event loop for HTTP, worker pool for blocking code.

#### Threading
- **Reactive:** Event loop (~1/core), worker pool for blocking IO.

#### Blocking vs. Non-blocking IO
- **Blocking IO:** Offloaded to worker thread pool.
- **Non-blocking IO:** Handled by event loop.

#### Sequence Diagram (Reactive)

    WorkerThread->>ThirdPartyAPI: Call
    ThirdPartyAPI-->>WorkerThread: Response
    WorkerThread->>EventLoop: Result
    EventLoop->>Client: HTTP Response
```
**Blocking:** Only worker thread blocked.

#### Resource Utilization
- **CPU:** Event loop efficient, workers limit blocking IO concurrency.
- **Memory:** Moderate (worker threads ~256–512/pod).

**In summary:**  
If your Java IO-intensive app needs even lower overhead, more explicit control, or a different programming paradigm than Spring/Quarkus/Vert.x, these options are worth considering. Many (like Akka, Ratpack, Helidon, Micronaut) are proven in production-grade, high-concurrency environments.
